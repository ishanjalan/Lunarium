Removed reference that should only be there in the compatibility version.

Updated bundles, adding all modded crops to their respective seasons (those bundles still take only 4 to complete)

1.2 - Real Cooking Bugfix
Updated Cooking items to be added by Friendship or Skill, as the TV is hardcoded not to work with new additions.

1.1 - Cooking Update
Adds 6 Cooking Items/Recipies unlocked by the TV
Adds all items to universal Likes, and adds some NPC specific Dislikes (some dislike all vegetables, etc)
Fixed corruption in springobjects, discoloration on ice crystals in the mines.
