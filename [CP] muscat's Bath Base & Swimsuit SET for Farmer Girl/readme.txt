First of all, no offense to Eric but Y'KNOW.. it wasn't such a pleasant look.
I was quite shocked when I first saw ma girl in the spa (aww bitter memories)
So I fixed the sprites of the bathing base & swimsuit to a more likable cuter look!

Flip flops by default, edit config.json to false if you want bare feet :D

BTW, just recommending you to use with Cuter Shoes, since the bathing base's farmer girl legs are 2 pixels.
This CP mod supports Vanilla & Cuter Shoes users both so no worries :)
