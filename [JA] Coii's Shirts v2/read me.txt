INFORMATION:
I converted Coii's shirt into JSON assets so that they can be compatible with the newest update.
This folder includes all of her shirts, plus Vanilla Stardew Valley's shirts.

SHIRTS:
Coii's Girls Sets Pack: Shirts 1-16
Vanilla Stardew Valley Shirts*: Shirts 16-127
Coii's Basic Shirts Pack: Shirts 128-271
* This includes dyed items.

REQUIREMENTS:
For the mod to function properly, you must download and place each of the following into your Stardew Valley mods folder:
	* SPACECORE by spacechase0: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1348?tab=description
	* JSON ASSETS by spacechase 0: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1720
	* CJB Item Spawner by CJBok and Pathoschild: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/93

CJB Item Spawner is needed to spawn the clothing items into the game.
