:: CREDITS & THANKS ::
♦ Thanks to tenthousandcats for inspiring me to make post-marriage events! And thanks for allowing me to make a late night event with Seb inspired by her pillow talk event with Shane.

♦ Thanks to 31fr4g3 for helping me edit some dialogue in the events!

:: A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT FARMHOUSE EVENTS ::
To see these events, have the upgraded farmhouse that let's you have kids (whether or not you have the cellar is irrelevant). Then edit the config file from "false" to "true." The config file will be automatically generated after running SMAPI for the first time after installing the mod. Editing the file to read true before you have the upgraded farmhouse will make the events fail or bug out really badly. 
Farmhouse events will be unviewable if you have the path the farmer takes to your bed/kitchen blocked by furniture. Sorry. I don't think most people will have anything in the way of the farmer's paths for these events, but who knows. Maybe you like your table half blocking your door? To each his own. :P But if you notice the event failing because of pathing, hit the skip button, restart your game without saving, and move whatever is in the farmer's path before attempting to trigger the event again.
