Do one of the two following steps   

1. copy the config file into Paritee's Better Farm Animal Variety folder(if you dont have that folder installParitee's Better Farm Animal Variety mod) 
and copy animal_shop_slime.png Paritee's Better Farm Animal Variety assets folder
-beaware this will overwright old config file so if you have another mod that uses BFAV either do this first befor adding there config or do second step instead-

2.copy the below code into BFAV's config text where last entry ends also copy animal_shop_slime.png into BFAV's assets folder
