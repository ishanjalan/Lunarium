Yoba knows she's been through a lot for a kid her age...$3#$e#I know it's kinda messed up, but part of me is really glad that she still looks for me when she has nightmares. The way I see it, it means she knows that she can count on me.$6#$e#*yawn* I think I'll go take a nap. Be careful out there, all right?$6",
