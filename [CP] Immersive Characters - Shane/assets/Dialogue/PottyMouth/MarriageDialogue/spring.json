				"Good_0": "So, how's my favorite person in the world doing today?$6",
				"Good_1": "Hey, feel my shirt...#$b#It's made of husband material.$6#$e#Yeah, that would have worked a lot better if we weren't already married.$h",
				"Good_2": "Morning, chickadee. So, I was thinking...$6#$b#...$l#$e#Huh, what? Sorry, I got distracted. Do you have any idea how good you look right now?$6",
				"Good_3": "Sometimes I feel like I'm really getting it together. I get all these chores done, I spend time with my family...#$b#It's nice. I'm feeling pretty proud of myself.$6",
				"Good_4": "Ugh... I just wanna crawl back into bed...$s#$b#I'll just stay in today, okay? I don't feel up to anything at all...#$e#Have a good day out there, bud.$6",
				"Good_5": "A little bit before we started dating, I got these really sappy romantic dreams about you.$6#$b#Yoba, I was so embarrassed about them.$3#$e#I kinda freaked out whenever I saw you afterwards, you know. Like I was scared you'd read my mind or something.$6#$e#Yeah, I do still dream about you every now and then. Not that big a deal to me, though...#$b#I know you're way sappier in real life.$h",
				"Good_6": "So picture this: I'm just getting on with my day, doing chores and stuff... when my wedding pendant swings into view.#$b#*sigh*... You know how distracting this thing is? I keep getting all soft and mushy whenever I lay my eyes on it.#$e#Take it off?$10#$b#Yeah sunshine, I get that it's the practical thing to do, but the only way to get this pendant off me is to pry it off my cold, dead body.#$b#I'm not taking it off for shit.$6",
				"Good_7": "I'm glad that we were neighbors before I moved in.$6#$b#It doesn't feel like I moved out and left Jas and Marnie behind. It's more like my home just got a lot bigger, you know?$6#$e#I hope you feel the same way. What's mine is yours, and all that.$6#$b#Besides, Marnie and Jas have been bugging me about getting you to visit more often.$h",
				"Good_8": "Sometimes I get scared that this is all a really great, elaborate fever dream. Like any minute I'll wake up in a hospital bed with a doctor telling me that I've been asleep for ten years.#$b#Maybe I've just been watching too many movies...$3#$e#Or maybe you're too good to be true, and I still can't believe that I'm the one who gets to wake up next to you every morning.$l",
				"Good_9": "Huh... You're wondering why I have this goofy grin on my face? You have a short memory span, don't you? *blush*$h#$e#Maybe I oughta remind you how you got me smiling like an idiot. You know, just so we're even.$6",
				"Neutral_0": "Are we doing okay on money, @?",
				"Neutral_1": "I'll do the laundry tomorrow morning before you get up... could you separate your darks from the whites before going to bed?",
				"Neutral_2": "I don't really feel like doing anything today.$s",
				"Neutral_3": "No matter how much I clean, the house keeps getting dirty again.#$e#*sigh* I guess it's no different from how things were on the ranch.$3",
				"Neutral_4": "Ugh, I just read that the Joja CEO made another billion in the past week. I bet he never even had to do half the crap we did when we worked there.$s#$e#I'm so glad I don't work for those bozos anymore.",
				"Neutral_5": "I woke up at one in the morning and couldn't get back to sleep, so I scrubbed and mopped all our floors.#$b#Well, looks like I just used up all my productivity for the month. At least the floors are shiny.$3#$e#My head's starting to hurt, so I think I'll go back to sleep now. G'night, bugaboo.",
				"Neutral_6": "Buh... my stomach doesn't feel too good...$s#$b#I guess I shouldn't have eaten all those poppers before going to bed last night...",
				"Neutral_7": "#$1 shaneDishwasher#Hey, do you think we should get a dishwasher? It could help us save water... and it would be a huge help with the chores.#$e#Sorry... I left last night's dishes in the sink. I couldn't get myself to wash them.#$e#I'll do them in a little bit, okay? Don't worry about it.$6",
				"Neutral_8": "Aw man... we're out of spicy pretzel snacks.",
				"Neutral_9": "*sigh*... I spilled some salsa in the fridge.$s#$b#Don't worry, I'll clean it up. Maybe we should start keeping stuff like that in airtight containers...",
				"Outdoor_0": "Sometimes I stop and realize that I'm nothing more than a bag of juicy, squishy flesh.#$e#But hey... that's just fine... what's life, anyway?$h",
				"Outdoor_1": "Ooohh... my tongue is swollen from eating too many pepper poppers.$s",
				"Outdoor_2": "*munch munch*#$b#Oh, hey. Want some poppers?$6#$b#I thought having breakfast out here might be nice.$6 [215]#$e#What do you mean, this isn't a proper breakfast?#$b#I'm an adult. Poppers can be breakfast food if I want them to be.$6",
				"Outdoor_3": "I guess my therapist was onto something when he told me to spend more time outdoors... this is pretty nice.$6#$e#So what are you doing today?$6",
				"Outdoor_4": "Hey, you're finally up.$6#$b#Yeah, I've been up since before dawn. I'm tired, but watching the sunrise was nice...$6#$e#How about you? I hope you slept better than I did.$6",
//Day/Night
				"Indoor_Day_0": "Hey, you're up! Check it out, the girls were pretty productive this morning.$h [174]#$b#I already chose the best ones for incubation. Figured we could make mayo or something out of these.$6 [174]#$b#Or maybe we could just make omelets?$6 [174]",
				"Indoor_Day_1": "You know, I think I'm starting to get the hang of cooking stuff.$h#$e#Here, try this.$6 [195 199]#$e#Not bad, right?$6",
				"Indoor_Day_2": "Uh... sorry about that burnt smell.$3#$b#Breakfast didn't turn out the way I thought it would.#$e#Here, we had a bunch of these in the pantry.$6 [403][0403][00403]",
				"Indoor_Day_3": "*smooch*... Mmm, it tastes like someone's been nibbling on pizza rolls.$6",
				"Indoor_Day_4": "...I  think I need some time alone today.$3#$b#It's not you, I just feel like shit. I wanna just lie in bed and not do anything.#$e#I promise I'll try not to wallow. I'll watch a movie or play some games or something.#$b#You have a good day, okay? Be safe.",
				"Indoor_Night_0": "Hey, I'm sorry that I'm not a bigger help around the farm. I know how to handle the animals, but I don't know much about the... agricultural side of it.$3#$e#I'm doing my best to cover the housework, though. I haven't burned the place down yet, so I think I'm doing okay.$6",
				"Indoor_Night_1": "Ughh... *gurgle*... I feel a little bloated... oof... too much Joja all-purpose dipping sauce.",
				"Indoor_Night_2": "I'm gonna make myself a warm compress before heading to bed.#$b#*sigh*... My knee's really acting up again.$s",
				"Indoor_Night_3": "You know, I used to worry that Jas didn't have any role models to look up to. I was a complete fucking mess when we moved here.#$e#I guess I realized that it's not all up to me. It's comforting to know that she has good people in her life who are looking out for her.$6",
				"Indoor_Night_4": "I actually had a pretty good day today.$6#$b#Not much happened, though. I just cleaned our coops and spent some time with the hens.#$b#Why don't you tell me about your day?$6",
				"Rainy_Day_0": "Yeesh, it's really coming down today. Do you really have to go out in this weather?#$e#Don't forget to bring an umbrella, okay? Be careful out there.",
				"Rainy_Day_1": "I'm gonna check to make sure we don't have any standing water around the house when it stops raining.#$b#Mosquitoes are a pain in the ass, and I don't want them laying eggs all over the place.$s",
				"Rainy_Day_2": "I think the roof's leaking...$3#$b#Don't worry, I'll deal with it. There are probably online tutorials about how to fix it, right?",
				"Rainy_Day_3": "Ugh... I woke up to water dripping on my face. Of course a leak would pop up right above our bed.$s#$e#I'll get it fixed as soon as I can. I think my pillow's already soaked through.",
				"Rainy_Day_4": "Hey, put on this jacket.#$b#I know I can't get you to stay in today, but I can at least try to keep you from getting a cold.#$e#Try not to do anything stupid and dangerous, okay? See ya later.$6",
				"Rainy_Night_0": "Well, you're completely soaked. I figured you'd forget to bring an umbrella again.#$b#*sigh*... Go on, I already drew you a bath. Fuck if I let you get sick from the rain.$6",
				"Rainy_Night_1": "Hmm... seems like a good night to microwave a few pizza rolls.#$e#Some people like to cook them in the oven, but it just takes too long for me. Plus I like that squishy texture.$h",
				"Rainy_Night_2": "I like gloomy weather, but I feel kinda bad for the hens. And the other animals too, of course.#$b#What? I have favorites, so sue me.$6",
				"Rainy_Night_3": "Here.$6 [199 457 727]#$e#Nothing like a stomach full of hot soup on a rainy night, right?$6#$b#I just hope I didn't make it too salty.$3",
				"Rainy_Night_4": "The tip-tappa-tip of the rain takes me to a different time... a different place.$3#$e#*sigh*... Memories sure have a way of just barging in whenever they feel like it.",
