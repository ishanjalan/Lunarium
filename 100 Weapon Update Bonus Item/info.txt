Old Item Sprite by Koucya

Just delete this if you want, this is not necessary for my mod.

v. 1.0.1
- Refined Item Sprite 

v. 1.0.2
- Changed item name from 'Pudding' to 'Custard Pudding'.
No need to delete the old file, I didn't change the folder name.

So Koucya decided that we make a new mod that would make use of this bonus item.
Well, whatever he will be still the one to do the sprites for it so... I don't mind.
And the creation of that mod means that I will be managing the weapon mod by myself once again.

That mod is currently in testing now. And we may need a hand...
