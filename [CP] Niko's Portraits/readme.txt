CONFIGURE OPTIONS


Instructions:

1. Install the mod as usual by placing the folder into Stardew Valley/Mods.
2. Run the game once with SMAPI to generate a config file in the mod folder.
3. Open config.JSON in Notepad and change the values to whatever you like (have a look at the pictures in the assets folder or on Nexus for reference).


Accepted values:

- Abigail wearing bow: "true" or "false" (defaults to true)
- Maru's nurse outfit: "scrubs" or "vanilla" (defaults to scrubs)


Thank you and enjoy~
