		!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!
		
		If you have any other "Karmylla's Immersive Maps" folder in your Mods folder - DELETE IT!
		My mod's name was changeed, and many are having issues with the newest updates.  If you do not delete old versions before updating, you may have these issues.
		
			!!!There is no "Karmylla's Immersive Map Edits" any more!!!

 When you first load this mod, a config file will appear on the Mod's folder, which you should edit to your liking. 

 This mod edition has one config option:


	- CONDITION: TownMap
		VALUES: Default, DustyOnly, false


		
 * TownMap - relates to which Town map you'll be using.

	1. "Default"
		For those who would like to have the full version of the town edits, including Dusty's new area and a few hidden secrets!
		- This is the default.
	
	2. "DustyOnly" 
		For those who want to play the original vanilla map, but want to have the Dusty area as well. 
		- Other than that, some areas were edited to make the Town map more "horse-friendly".
	
	3. "False" 
		Setting it to this value will make you play with the vanilla Town map. 
		- This is to be used by those who want to play with my NPC map edits but not my Town map edits.
		- Those who play with Stardew Valley Reimagined by DaisyNiko must set this conditional to false!
	
	
			===== DO NOT FORGET =====
			
			You need Reset Terrain Features to reset the bushes - if you aren't playing with a new save!
			Load your save file and follow the directions on the mod page!
			And you will see the bushes in their new place!
