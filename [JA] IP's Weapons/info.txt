Hey, You!
The one who downloaded this mod. Thank you!
Please if you have weapon suggestions, let me know! And I shall add those weapons.
Also, if there are problems with the mod please tell me and I shall do my best to fix it.
I also apologize if I seem too stupid with these type of mod. It was my first weapon mod.
And please if you see this mod somewhere else other than Nexus. Tell me.

If SMAPI doesn't load any items, then it means you've already had too much items added by mods.
I am giving you the permission to delete the weapons you do not use to have Json Assets load the other items once again.

Some of this weapons will only be sold once you've had enough friendship points with a certain NPC or at a certain season.
And I know, don't worry the sprite of scalpel also hurts my eyes.

If you need something, ping me at discord 'Immortal Prince #6922'.

Thank you Ren8059, for telling me what I did wrong why those weapons were all classified as swords.

Known Bugs: (On mobile. I only play SV in Android, and these mods are also made and tested in the same platform.)
