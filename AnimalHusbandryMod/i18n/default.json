	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.ReRunDisplaySuffix":"(Re-run)",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Announcement": "Welcome to \"Ranching Heaven\". We're back again with another animal tip for y'all. Now listen up:",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Buildings": "Thinking of raising your own farm animals? They'll need a place to live first! To do that, you'll need a bunch of wood, stone and money. Visit your local carpenter for details.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Coop": "Let's talk coops. It's the cheapest of the buildings that can house farm animals, and probably the one you should start with. It provides shelter to small animals like chickens, ducks and rabbits. But you might need to prove yourself before your animal supplier sells them all to you.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Silo": "Even if you don't plan to own any farm animals soon, it might be useful to build a silo. Then you can start to store hay from the grass you cut with a scythe. When you finally need it, you'll have plenty.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Barn": "To house bigger farm animals, you need to build a barn. Like coops, you'll also need wood, stone, and money.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.FeedingBasket": "Animals love to be petted, but they'll love you even more if you give them treats. But you can't just give treats by hand; you need a feeding basket to do it properly. They're handmade by a handful of people and can't be bought. You'll need to befriend your animal supplier to get one.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.CaveCarrot": "When you get your feeding basket, you'll ask yourself \"What treats do my animals like?\". Well, each kind has a different preference, but there's one that's universally liked. All farm animals like cave carrots. Don't forget that!",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.SpringAnimalContest": "Spring is coming to an end... Do you know what that means? Animal Contests! It's said that farm animals that win these contests become more fertile. Poultry may produce up to two eggs a day and mammals' pregnancy time is said to be shortened by about ten percent.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Wheat": "Summer's coming, so it's time to plant some wheat. Why? Because chickens love wheat. It's cheap and grows really fast. It's also a good time to nurture some fruit trees; birds love mango and starfruit in particular!",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.CatDogTreat": "Do you have a cat or a dog? If so, you should know that if you use the feeding basket to give them food, they'll like you even more. They both love beef, tuna and largemouth bass.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Radish": "It's almost time for the first radish harvest of the season. Its peppery flavor is so refreshing, your cows will be over the moon when you give them some!",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.TreatQuality": "In case you haven't noticed, your farm animals prefer treats of better quality. Pets, however, don't seem to notice the difference.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.TreatMilk": "Newborn animals know how to drink their mother's milk without any help. But if you give them a bottle as a supplement, they'll mature faster. Just don't give the calves and kids a large one. It's too much for them.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Insemination": "Barns can support pregnant animals, but most animals are too shy to get pregnant by themselves. So if you want control over their reproduction, you'll need an upgraded barn in order to inseminate them yourself... With an insemination syringe, obviously.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Grape": "Have you been foraging grapes? You can find wild ones during summer, and your goats will love you for it. You can also plant them in fall, so they'll be happy for two seasons.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.MeatPrice": "Have you ever wondered whether it's better to sell your animals or to sell their meat? Well, animal buyers will never pay you more than what the animal is worth in meat. So for bigger profit, always go with meat, but for instant cash, you might need to sell outright.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.BokChoy": "Fall's coming soon, and as with every new season, there's new treats you can harvest for your animals. Ducks love bok choy, so you might consider planting some for them, while squirrels love the hazelnuts you find lying around. Warthogs prefer mushrooms.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.TreatIsNotHay": "If you're giving your animals lots of treats, I hope you're not forgetting to also give them hay or let them eat grass outside. Treats are very nutritious, but they don't replace their regular food.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.TreatPrice": "Animals like to receive more than one kind treat, but how do you know which ones they like the most? It seems they value food the same way as we do, so how much they like a treat is proportional to its price. But they're not fooled by your sales expertise, so price bonuses from professions don't apply.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.PregnancyTime": "Each animal has a different pregnancy time. Sheep are the fastest, followed closely by rabbits. Pigs take the longest time, needing a full season from insemination to reach maturity. If you take a closer look at your animals you can tell when they'll be ready for birth.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Corn": "Are you having a good corn harvest? As most people know, corn is chickens' favorite treat. So give them your spare corn and soon you'll be getting the best eggs you could ask for.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.PregnancyRoom": "Animals will only give birth if there's room for the baby in the same building. You don't need to have free room throughout the pregnancy though.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.MeatDishesBuffs": "Meat is very nutritious, but expensive. If you ever decide to cook and some, it will always feel a little special.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.FallAnimalContest": "Besides the Spirit's Eve, some towns also organize an animal contest at the end of the season. It's said that the winners of these contests produce top quality goods. That's really nice, don't you think?",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Heater": "Winter's as cold to the animals as it's to us, but they can't put on any clothes. To warm up, they'll stay inside the whole season. But that's not enough to keep them happy; you'll need a heater in each building to keep getting the best quality products.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.ChikenCowMeat": "Chickens and cows aren't the most profitable animals to raise for meat, but there are some special recipes that require them. It's the cheapest way to get some animal protein in your diet.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.AgeAnimalContest": "Animal Contest Tip: Most contests will have an animal age category. That's so animal owners feel motivated to continue raising new participants. Animals at 3 to 4 months of age will earn the most points, so plan ahead.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.ProfessionAnimalProductQuality": "This one's for you, professional rancher. Do you know that if you specialize in coop or barn animals, it'll increase the probability of getting better quality products from them by thirty percent?",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.TreatAverageAnimalContest": "Animal Contest Tip: Animals won't eat treats everyday, but they won't like if you only give them treats once a month. This frequency is evaluated in most contests. Give them a treat at least once a week so as to get the most points.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.RabbitPregnancy": "Rabbits are really shy animals; they'll never reproduce in coops. But you can inseminate them yourself with an insemination syringe. Also, coops have no limit for how many pregnant animals they can hold, so use that to your advantage.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Kale": "After a long winter, you're probably wondering what can you plant this season that your might animals like. If you have sheep, the answer is kale, while foxes love wild salmonberries.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Cauliflower": "Have you got yourself a rabbit yet? If so, you should probably know that rabbits love cauliflower. You should plant some as soon as spring starts, since they take a long time to grow.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.CrystalFruit": "While you're waiting for your cauliflower to mature, you can give your rabbits leftover crystal fruit from the winter season... Why didn't I give you that information before? Sponsorship! We've got to pay the bills somehow!",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.ParticipantAnimalContest": "Animal Contest Tip: Even if you don't think it can win, it's still worth entering your animal in a contest. It'll be really happy just for participating. But don't do it if you don't plan to show up, as your animal will become really unhappy if it's forgotten.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.BeanHotpot": "If you planted green beans at the start of the season, they should be almost ready for harvest. It's bad for your animals to eat them raw, but ducks love the stuff cooked. Bean Hotpot is safe for them.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.FriendshipAnimalContest": "Animal Contest Tip: This tip is so basic that I shouldn't even need to mention it. An animal's affection toward you is the category that can award you the most points in a contest. Treat your animals well and you should have no problem.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.TreatVarietyAnimalContest": "Animal Contest Tip: If you could only have ice cream or cake for the rest of your life, which would you choose? Not a fair decision to make, right? So why would you only give your animals one kind of treat? The variety in an animal's diet is evaluated in most contests. Make sure it's eaten at least 3 different kinds of treats to be awarded the most points.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Apple": "A fruit tree is an expensive, long term investment, but it requires no work after planting the sapling. So if you get yourself an apple tree now, you'll be getting fresh apple treats for your goats every day in the fall. The best part is that each year, the apples will increase in quality... and so will the goats' love for you.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Melon": "Pigs can eat almost anything, but what will make them love you most? Melons! Give them big, fresh, juicy, pink melons regularly and they'll find more truffles than you can handle.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.HeritageAnimalContest": "Animal Contest Tip: Most animal contest judges won't admit it, but they're a little biased when evaluating an animal whose parent is a previous winner. It's almost as if they get a bonus point just for being from prized stock. Keep that in mind.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.RedCabbage": "Red cabbages are starting to bloom, so it's time for the ultimate rabbit tip. Red cabbage is their favorite treat by far. Just don't give them too much, as it can make them a little gassy.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Amaranth": "You might already know this one, but here it is anyway. Amaranth is a delight to cows. An amaranth-fed cow will grow faster than any other animal. Stock some up in the fall if you plan to raise cows.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Yam": "Yams take some time to grow, so you should probably start planting them now if you want to get two harvest this fall. I know they're not the most profitable vegetables, but sheep could care less. It's their favorite treat, so if you want happy sheep, you'll want some yams.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Artichoke": "The artichoke, like the tomato, is wrongly considered a vegetable. It's actually a flower, but your goats couldn't care less! It's their favorite treat, and they'll eat it no matter what you call it.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Pumpkin": "If you're going by the book, you should have at least one field of pumpkins ready to harvest around this week. If you own pigs, I'm sure their mouths will be watering. Don't be selfish, give them some! It's their favorite treat.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.PigsWinterPart1": "Pigs won't find truffles in winter because they can't go outside. Since they won't be profitable anyway, it's probably a good idea to get their meat at the start of the season and replace them with another animal.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.PigWinterPart2": "If you're following my tip about pigs in winter, you may want to keep and impregnate one so you'll have a brand new piglet for the coming spring.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.PigWinterPart3": "If you replaced your pigs with new animals, make sure to give them a milk supplement so they reach maturity faster. Then keep feeding them treats at every opportunity, so they'll grow faster and increase the quality of their products and their innate value.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.PigWinterPart4": "I hope you didn't get too attached to your winter animals, because you'll soon need to make room in your barn for the new piglet! You can also sell or get meat from animals that are getting old instead.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.PigWinterPart5": "With your new piglet gambooling about the barn, I hope you've given it a treat! You still have time to give 3 more treats before spring, so it can start the year finding truffles like a champion.",
	"TV.LivingWithTheAnimals.Episode.Retirement": "Folks, I've got an announcement to make. This is the last new episode of Ranching Heaven before my retirement. I'm going to live with my twin brother on his farm, where he sorely needs my help with his own animals. Oh, and I've been told the station's going to start playing reruns next year. Take care! ",

	"AnimalContest.Dialog.MaruAct.Lewis.FirstTime1": "What is this, Maru? If your pet is inside, you'll have take it out so I can do the evaluation.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.MaruAct.Maru.FirstTime1": "This IS my pet. It's called the Partner Electronic Trinket, or P.E.T.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.MaruAct.Lewis.FirstTime2": "As interesting as your P.E.T. seems, the contest is for animals only.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.MaruAct.Maru.FirstTime2": "The invitation says farm animals and pets. Plenty of pet robots exist nowadays.$3#$b#I'm trying to build my own.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.MaruAct.Lewis.FirstTime3": "Yes, but the invitation also says Stardew Valley ANIMAL Contest. So you know it isn't for robot pets.#$b#Anyway, how would I evaluate it? Can it do tricks?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.MaruAct.Maru.FirstTime3": "I'm still working on tricks, but it already eats treats. It likes oil, grease, and batteries.$h",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.MaruAct.Lewis.FirstTime4": "Well, a pet needs to know some tricks. So I'm disqualifying it.#$b#I'll see the next participant.",

	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Shane.FirstTime2": "Thanks Lewis. Your words mean a lot to me.$6",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Lewis.FirstTime3": "Now let's see if you're as good at preparing chickens for the contest as you are at breeding for their colors.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Lewis.FirstTime4": "Huh... You did great for a first timer, but you're still missing a thing or two.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Shane.FirstTime3": "This hen was one of the first blue chickens, so I know it's not as young as required.#$b#Since I was still testing things for passing down traits, it also had to have a specific diet. So I couldn't give it as many treats as I wanted.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Lewis.FirstTime5": "Oh, I see Marnie has taught you well. I'm sure you'll do better next time, then.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.ShaneAct.Lewis.OtherTimes1": "Great to see you at the contest again, Shane.",

	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.FirstTime2": "Because he lives with me and can't fly. But once I told him about the contest, he wanted to come.",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.FirstTime3": "Well, I can't say I've ever seen a case like this. But there's no rule against it.#$b#Does it know any tricks?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.FirstTime3": "Why don't you ask him yourself?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.FirstTime4": "Er... do you know any tricks?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.FirstTime5": "Nice, you answered me, any more tricks?$h",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.FirstTime4": "It's my fault, I should have talked to him how the contest work, so he could prepare better.$s",

	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.OtherTimes2": "I'll let him show you.$h",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Lewis.OtherTimes3": "That was wonderful.$h#$b#I know it isn't your pet, but I'll evaluate it as such since you brought it, okay Emily?",
	"AnimalContest.Dialog.EmilyAct.Emily.OtherTimes3": "That's fine, we know the rules.",
