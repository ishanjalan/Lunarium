
Be My Valentine MOD by Taskmaster


Introduction
------------
I appreciate that you took a few moments to check out another of my silly mail MODs.  This MOD will send a handful of Valentine messages to the player
on the 14th of Spring.  The day after the Egg Festival is a great time for villagers to reach out to friends in brotherly and sisterly love.

This MOD will replace the normal letter background with a Valentine's Day themed one, except for any Wizard letters, but only on the 14th of Spring.  The
background will be applied to any normal letter you happen to receive on the 14th as well, again except for letters on Wizard stationary.  Currently there
is only a single set of Valentine's Day letters.  Eventually I hope to expand it to add a little more variety, but for now I just wanted to provide 
so Valentine's Day fun.

If you are a Steam user, I have created two Community Guides that you might enjoy.  They are not your typical regurgitation of the Stardew Valley Wiki,
but are short stories based on the game designed to add "lore" to the game experience.  Folks seem to enjoy them and I am sure you will too.
